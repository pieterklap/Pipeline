fasta_file = /PATH/to/fasta.fasta
#	Used by: comet, tandem, MSGFPlus
#	Sets teh path to the fasta file that all the programs use

Decoy_Database = 0 
#   (0: don't search decoy database (Default), 1: search decoy database)

NumThreads = 0
#   Used by: comet, MSGFPlus
#   (Number of concurrent threads to be executed, Default: Number of available cores (0))

#
#	Masses
#

PrecursorMassTolerance = 20ppm
#   Used by: comet, tandem, MSGFPlus 
#   (e.g. 2.5Da, 20ppm or 0.5Da,2.5Da, Default: 20ppm)

IsotopeErrorRange = 0.1
#	Used by: MSGFPlus
#	(Range of allowed isotope peak errors, Default:0,1)
#	Takes into account of the error introduced by chooosing a non-monoisotopic peak for fragmentation.
#	The combination of PrecursorMassTolerance and IsotopeErrorRange determines the precursor mass tolerance.
#	E.g. "PrecursorMassTolerance 20ppm IsotopeErrorRange -1,2" tests abs(exp-calc-n*1.00335Da)<20ppm for n=-1, 0, 1, 2.

NumTasks =  
#	Used by: MSGFPlus
#	(Override the number of tasks to use on the threads, Default: (internally calculated based on inputs))
#	   More tasks than threads will reduce the memory requirements of the search, but will be slower (how much depends on the inputs).
#	   1<=tasks<=numThreads: will create one task per thread, which is the original behavior.
#	   tasks=0: use default calculation - minimum of: (threads*3) and (numSpectra/250).
#	   tasks<0: multiply number of threads by abs(tasks) to determine number of tasks (i.e., -2 => "2 * numThreads" tasks).
#	   One task per thread will use the most memory, but will usually finish the fastest.
#	   2-3 tasks per thread will use comparably less memory, but may cause the search to take 1.5 to 2 times as long.

verbose = 0 
#	Used by: MSGFPlus
#	(0: report total progress only (Default), 1: report total and per-thread progress/status)

FragmentMethodID = 0

MS2DetectorID = 0
#	(0: Low-res LCQ/LTQ (Default), 1: Orbitrap/FTICR, 2: TOF, 3: Q-Exactive)

EnzymeID = 1 
#	(0: unspecific cleavage, 1: Trypsin (Default), 2: Chymotrypsin, 3: Lys-C, 4: Lys-N, 5: glutamyl endopeptidase, 6: Arg-C, 7: Asp-N, 8: alphaLP, 9: no cleavage)

ProtocolID = 0
#	0: Automatic (Default), 1: Phosphorylation, 2: iTRAQ, 3: iTRAQPhospho, 4: TMT, 5: Standard)

Tolerable_Termini = 2 
#	(Number of Tolerable Termini, Default: 2)
#	E.g. For trypsin, 0: non-tryptic, 1: semi-tryptic, 2: fully-tryptic peptides only.

ModificationFileName = 
#	(Modification file, Default: standard amino acids with fixed C+57)

MinPepLength = 6
#	(Minimum peptide length to consider, Default: 6)

MaxPepLength = 40
#	(Maximum peptide length to consider, Default: 40)

MinCharge = 2
#	(Minimum precursor charge to consider if charges are not specified in the spectrum file, Default: 2)
	
MaxCharge = 3
#	(Maximum precursor charge to consider if charges are not specified in the spectrum file, Default: 3)

NumMatchesPerSpec = 1
#	(Number of matches per spectrum to be reported, Default: 1)
	
addFeatures = 0
#	(0: output basic scores only (Default), 1: output additional features)

ChargeCarrierMass = 1,00727649
#	(Mass of charge carrier, Default: mass of proton (1.00727649))
