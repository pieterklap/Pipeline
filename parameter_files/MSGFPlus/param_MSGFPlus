# every line that starts with a "#" is treated as a comment
# some options are commented out by default to use them remove the "#" in front of them 
# use ',' as a decimal point

DatabaseFile -d /home/pieter/pipeline/fasta/up000005640.fasta
#	(*.fasta or *.fa)

PrecursorMassTolerance -t 10ppm
#	(e.g. 2.5Da, 20ppm or 0.5Da,2.5Da, Default: 20ppm)
#	Use comma to set asymmetric values. E.g. "-t 0.5Da,2.5Da" will set 0.5Da to the minus (expMass<theoMass) and 2.5Da to plus (expMass>theoMass)

IsotopeErrorRange -ti 0,1
#	(Range of allowed isotope peak errors, Default:0,1)
#	Takes into account of the error introduced by chooosing a non-monoisotopic peak for fragmentation.
#	The combination of -t and -ti determines the precursor mass tolerance.
#	E.g. "-t 20ppm -ti -1,2" tests abs(exp-calc-n*1.00335Da)<20ppm for n=-1, 0, 1, 2.

#NumThreads -thread
#	(Number of concurrent threads to be executed, Default: Number of available cores)

#NumTasks -tasks
#	(Override the number of tasks to use on the threads, Default: (internally calculated based on inputs))
#	More tasks than threads will reduce the memory requirements of the search, but will be slower (how much depends on the inputs).
#	1<=tasks<=numThreads: will create one task per thread, which is the original behavior.
#	tasks=0: use default calculation - minimum of: (threads*3) and (numSpectra/250).
#	tasks<0: multiply number of threads by abs(tasks) to determine number of tasks (i.e., -2 => "2 * numThreads" tasks).
#	One task per thread will use the most memory, but will usually finish the fastest.
#	2-3 tasks per thread will use comparably less memory, but may cause the search to take 1.5 to 2 times as long.

verbose -verbose 0
#	0/1 (0: report total progress only (Default), 1: report total and per-thread progress/status)

Decoy_search -tda 1
#	0/1 (0: don't search decoy database (Default), 1: search decoy database)

FragmentMethodID -m 0
#	(0: As written in the spectrum or CID if no info (Default), 1: CID, 2: ETD, 3: HCD, 4: UVPD)

MS2DetectorID -inst 0
#	(0: Low-res LCQ/LTQ (Default), 1: Orbitrap/FTICR, 2: TOF, 3: Q-Exactive)

EnzymeID -e 9
#	Don't use 0 as it doesn't work with idconvert.
#	(0: unspecific cleavage, 1: Trypsin (Default), 2: Chymotrypsin, 3: Lys-C, 4: Lys-N, 5: glutamyl endopeptidase, 6: Arg-C, 7: Asp-N, 8: alphaLP, 9: no cleavage)

ProtocolID -protocol 0
#	(0: Automatic (Default), 1: Phosphorylation, 2: iTRAQ, 3: iTRAQPhospho, 4: TMT, 5: Standard)

Tolerable_Termini -ntt 1
#	(Number of Tolerable Termini, Default: 2)
#	E.g. For trypsin, 0: non-tryptic, 1: semi-tryptic, 2: fully-tryptic peptides only.

#ModificationFileName -mod
#	(Modification file, Default: standard amino acids with fixed C+57)

minPepLength -minLength 6
#	(Minimum peptide length to consider, Default: 6)

MaxPepLength -maxLength 40
#	(Maximum peptide length to consider, Default: 40)

MinCharge -minCharge 2
#	(Minimum precursor charge to consider if charges are not specified in the spectrum file, Default: 2)

MaxCharge -maxCharge 3
#	(Maximum precursor charge to consider if charges are not specified in the spectrum file, Default: 3)

NumMatchesPerSpec -n 1
#	(Number of matches per spectrum to be reported, Default: 1)

AddFeatures -addFeatures 0
# 0/1 (0: output basic scores only (Default), 1: output additional features)

ChargeCarrierMass -ccm 1.00727649
# ChargeCarrierMass (Mass of charge carrier, Default: mass of proton (1.00727649))
