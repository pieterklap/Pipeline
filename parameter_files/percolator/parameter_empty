#Options:
#-p <value>
#          Cpos, penalty for mistakes made on positive examples. 
#          Set by cross validation if not specified.
#-n <value>
#          Cneg, penalty for mistakes made on negative examples.
#          Set by cross validation if not specified or if -p is not specified.
#-t <value>
#          False discovery rate threshold for evaluating best cross validation 
#          result and reported end result. Default = 0.01.
#-F <value>
#          False discovery rate threshold to define positive examples in 
#          training. Set to testFDR if 0. Default = 0.01.
#-i <number>
#          Maximal number of iterations. Default = 10.
#-N <number>
#          Only train an SVM on a subset of <x> PSMs, and use the resulting 
#          score vector to evaluate the other PSMs. Recommended when analyzing 
#          huge numbers (>1 million) of PSMs. When set to 0, all PSMs are used 
#          for training as normal. Default = 0.
#-x
#          Quicker execution by reduced internal cross-validation.
#-V <[-]?featureName>
#          Use given feature name as initial search direction, can be negated 
#          to indicate that a lower value is better.
#-v <level>
#          Set verbosity of output: 0=no processing info, 5=all. Default = 2
#-o
#          Do not stop execution when encountering questionable SVM inputs or results.
#-u
#          Use unit normalization [0-1] instead of standard deviation normalization
#-R
#          Measure performance on test set each iteration
#-O
#          Override error check and do not fall back on default score vector 
#          in case of suspect score vector from SVM.
#-S <value>
#          Set seed of the random number generator. Default = 1
#-D
#          Include description of correct features, i.e. features describing 
#          the difference between the observed and predicted isoelectric 
#          point, retention time and precursor mass.
#-K
#          Retention time features are calculated as in Klammer et al. 
#          Only available if -D is set.
#-r <filename>
#          Output tab delimited results of peptides to a file instead of 
#          stdout (will be ignored if used with -U option)
#-B <filename>
#          Output tab delimited results for decoy peptides into a file (will 
#          be ignored if used with -U option)
#-m <filename>
#          Output tab delimited results of PSMs to a file instead of stdout
#-M <filename>
#          Output tab delimited results for decoy PSMs into a file
#-U
#          Do not remove redundant peptides, keep all PSMS and exclude peptide 
#          level probabilities.
#-y
#          Use the mix-max method to assign q-values and PEPs. Note that this 
#          option only has an effect if the input PSMs are from separate 
#          target and decoy searches. This is the default setting.
#-Y
#          Replace the mix-max method by target-decoy competition for 
#          assigning q-values and PEPs. If the input PSMs are from separate 
#          target and decoy searches, Percolator's SVM scores will be 
#          used to eliminate the lower scoring target or decoy PSM(s) of
#          each scan+expMass combination. If the input PSMs are detected to be 
#          coming from a concatenated search, this option will be turned on 
#          automatically, as this is incompatible with the mix-max 
#          method. In case this detection fails, turn this option on explicitly.
#-I <value>
#          Specify the type of target-decoy search: "auto" (Percolator 
#          attempts to detect the search type automatically), "concatenated" 
#          (single search on concatenated target-decoy protein db) or 
#          "separate" (two searches, one against target and one against
#          decoy protein db). Default = "auto".
#-s
#          Skip validation of input file against xml schema.
#-f <value>
#          Use the picked protein-level FDR to infer protein probabilities. 
#          Provide the fasta file as the argument to this flag, which will 
#          be used for protein grouping based on an in-silico digest. If no 
#          fasta file is available or protein grouping is not desired, set this 
#          flag to "auto" to skip protein grouping.
#-A
#          Use the Fido algorithm to infer protein probabilities
#-l <filename>
#          Output tab delimited results of proteins to a file instead of 
#          stdout (Only valid if option -A or -f is active)
#-L <filename>
#          Output tab delimited results for decoy proteins into a file (Only 
#          valid if option -A or -f is active)
#-P <value>
#          Define the text pattern to identify decoy proteins in the 
#          database for the picked-protein algorithm. This will have no 
#          effect on the target/decoy labels specified in the input file. 
#          Default = "random_".
#-z
#          Type of enzyme used for in silico protein digestion for picked 
#          protein-level FDR estimation. One of 
#          "no_enzyme","elastase","pepsin","proteinasek","thermolysin","trypsin p",
#          "chymotrypsin","lys-n","lys-c","arg-c","asp-n","glu-c","trypsin". Default="trypsin".
#-c
#          By default, if the peptides associated with protein A are a 
#          proper subset of the peptides associated with protein B, then
#          protein A is eliminated and all the peptides are considered as 
#          evidence for protein B. Note that this filtering is done based on 
#          the complete set of peptides in the database, not based on the 
#          identified peptides in the search results. Alternatively, if this 
#          option is set and if all of the identified peptides associated 
#          with protein B are also associated with protein A, then Percolator 
#          will report a comma-separated list of protein IDs, where the 
#          full-length protein B is first in the list and the fragment protein 
#          A is listed second. Commas inside protein IDs will be replaced by 
#          semicolons. Not available for Fido.
#-g
#          If this option is set and multiple database proteins contain exactly 
#          the same set of peptides, then the IDs of these duplicated proteins 
#          will be reported as a comma-separated list, instead of 
#          the default behavior of randomly discarding all but one of the 
#          proteins. Commas inside protein IDs will be replaced by 
#          semicolons. Not available for Fido.
#-a <value>
#          Set Fido's probability with which a present protein emits an 
#          associated peptide. Set by grid search if not specified.
#-b <value>
#          Set Fido's probability of creation of a peptide from noise. Set by 
#          grid search if not specified.
#-G <value>
#          Set Fido's prior probability that a protein is present in the 
#          sample. Set by grid search if not specified.
#-q
#          Output empirical p-values and q-values for Fido using 
#          target-decoy analysis to XML output (only valid if -X flag is present).
#-d <value>
#          Setting the gridsearch-depth to 0 (fastest), 1 or 2 (slowest) 
#          controls how much computational time is required for the 
#          estimation of alpha, beta and gamma parameters for Fido. Default = 0.
#-T <value>
#          Apply the specified threshold to PSM, peptide and protein 
#          probabilities to obtain a faster estimate of the alpha, beta and 
#          gamma parameters. Default = 0; Recommended when set = 0.2.
#-C
#          Do not approximate the posterior distribution by allowing large 
#          graph components to be split into subgraphs. The splitting is done 
#          by duplicating peptides with low probabilities. Splitting continues 
#          until the number of possible configurations of each subgraph is below 2^18.
#-E <value>
#          To speed up inference, proteins for which none of the associated 
#          peptides has a probability exceeding the specified threshold 
#          will be assigned probability = 0. Default = 0.01.
#-H <value>
#          Q-value threshold that will be used in the computation of the MSE 
#          and ROC AUC score in the grid search. Recommended 0.05 for 
#          normal size datasets and 0.1 for large datasets. Default = 0.1
#[EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE]
# --nested-xval-bins <value>                   
#           Number of nested cross validation bins within each cross validation 
#           bin. This should reduce overfitting of the hyperparameters. Default = 1.
#[EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE]
# --spectral-counting-fdr <value>              
#           Activates spectral counting on protein level (either 
#           --fido-protein or --picked-protein has to be set) at the specified 
#           PSM q-value threshold. Adds two columns, "spec_count_unique" and 
#           "spec_count_all", to the protein tab separated output, containing 
#           the spectral count for the peptides unique to the protein and 
#           the spectral count including shared peptides respectively.
#[EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE]
# --train-best-positive                        
#           Enforce that, for each spectrum, at most one PSM is included in the 
#           positive set during each training iteration. If the user only 
#           provides one PSM per spectrum, this filter will have no effect.
#[EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE]
# --train-fdr-initial <value>                  
#           Set the FDR threshold for the first iteration. This is useful in 
#           cases where the original features do not display a good separation 
#           between targets and decoys. In subsequent iterations, the normal 
#           --trainFDR will be used.
#[EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE]
# --parameter-file <filename>                  
#           Read flags from a parameter file. If flags are specified on the 
#           command line as well, these will override the ones in the parameter file.
