#
##"user_threshold" 0.05
#   Default 0.05. float between 0 and 1, used to define custom significance threshold. 
#
##"all_results" false
#   Boolean. Default false. If "true", the API also returns results that are below the significance threshold.
#
##"ordered" false
#   Boolean. Default false. If true, the API performs ordered query. Read more.
#
##"combined" false
#   Boolean. Default false. If true, runs queries simultaneously and combines the result. See query for how to supply more than one query in request. Read more.
#
##"measure_underrepresentation" false
#   Boolean, default false. If true, g:GOSt returns significantly under-represented functional terms. Read more.
#
##"no_iea" false
#   Boolean, default false. If true, g:GOSt excludes electronic annotations from GO terms. Read more.
#
##"domain_scope" "annotated"
#   String, default 'annotated'. Other options 'known' or 'custom'. If set to 'custom', the 'background' parameter must be populated. Read more.
#
##"numeric_ns" "ENTREZGENE"
#   String. Default "ENTREZGENE". Indicating which namespace to use when IDs are numeric. Read more.
#
"significance_threshold_method" "fdr"
#   String. Multiple testing correction method. Default 'g_SCS'. Other options are 'bonferroni' and 'fdr' Read more.
#
##"background"
#   List of strings. Should be a list of gene-ids (preferably ensembl id-s) to be considered as the statistical background for the query. To use this parameter, 'domain_scope' should be set to custom. TODO: check if true. Read more.
#
##"output" "json"
#   String. Default "json". No other options should be used at the moment.
#
##"no_evidences" false
#   Boolean. Default false. If true, skips lookup for evidence codes. Speeds up queries, if there is no interest in evidence codes.
